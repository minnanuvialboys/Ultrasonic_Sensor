Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement
- This project demonstrates how to use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an obstacle using an Arduino. 
- The distance is calculated based on the time taken for an ultrasonic pulse to travel to the obstacle and back to the sensor.

Components Used :
1.Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
2.Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
3.Jumper wiresBreadboard (optional)

Circuit Diagram:
Make sure to connect the components as per the circuit diagram provided in this repository. 
The ultrasonic sensor has four pins:
- VCC: Connects to 5V on the Arduino
- GND: Connects to GND on the Arduino
- Trig: Connects to digital pin 11 on the Arduino
- Echo: Connects to digital pin 12 on the Arduino
